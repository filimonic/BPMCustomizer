Steam Big Picture Mod Customizer

This tool allows you to customize your Steam Big Picture mode look like you want (in a limited way) 
You can:

* Remove any menu entries from Quit menu on main screen
* Remove SHOP button from main screen and (if you want), move it to the top of main screen, near to Quit button
* Remove QUIT or SETTINGS menu button from main screen
* Remove your profile icon buttons (both avatar and big button with your nickname) from main screen
* Add SLEEP, SHUTDOWN or RESTART buttons next to LIBRARY button
* And it is safe for Steam, no need to run Steam with -noValidate flag or make it offline.
